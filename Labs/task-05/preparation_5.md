## Preparation tasks (done before the lab at home)

1. Read the [7-segment display tutorial](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/blog/7-segment-display-tutorial.html) and find out what is the difference between:
   * Common Cathode 7-segment display (CC SSD)
   * Common Anode 7-segment display (CA SSD)

The difference between the two displays, as their name suggests, is that the common cathode has all the cathodes of the 7-segments connected directly together and the common anode has all the anodes of the 7-segments connected together and is illuminated as follows.

2. In the following table, write the binary values of the segments for display 0 to 9 on a common anode 7-segment display.

   | **Digit** | **A** | **B** | **C** | **D** | **E** | **F** | **G** | **DP** |
   | :-------: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :----: |
   |     0     |   0   |   0   |   0   |   0   |   0   |   0   |   1   |   1    |
   |     1     |   1   |   0   |   0   |   1   |   1   |   1   |   1   |   1    |
   |     2     |   0   |   0   |   1   |   0   |   0   |   1   |   0   |   1    |
   |     3     |   0   |   0   |   0   |   0   |   1   |   1   |   0   |   1    |
   |     4     |   1   |   0   |   0   |   1   |   1   |   0   |   0   |   1    |
   |     5     |   0   |   1   |   0   |   0   |   1   |   0   |   0   |   1    |
   |     6     |   0   |   1   |   0   |   0   |   0   |   0   |   0   |   1    |
   |     7     |   0   |   0   |   0   |   1   |   1   |   1   |   1   |   1    |
   |     8     |   0   |   0   |   0   |   0   |   0   |   0   |   0   |   1    |
   |     9     |   0   |   0   |   0   |   0   |   1   |   0   |   1   |   1    |

3. Use schematic of the [Multi-function shield](../../Docs/arduino_shield.pdf) and find out the connection of seven-segment display. What is the purpose of two shift registers 74HC595?

QA --> a
QB --> b
QC --> c
QD --> d
QE --> e
QF --> f
QG --> g
QH --> DP
